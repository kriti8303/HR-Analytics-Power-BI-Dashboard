## Overview :
This repository contains an HR analytics dashboard developed using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights and visualizations based on the HR dataset. In this project, we analyzed the attendance data of the last 3 months to provide insights to the HR Generalist. By leveraging data extraction, transformation, and loading techniques, we generated valuable insights using Power BI Desktop.

## Problem Statement : 
Atliq Technologies' HR Generalist sought insights from the attendance data, collected in key format over the last 3 months. The objective was to gain insights into employee attendance patterns, determine retention strategies, and identify reasons behind sick leave percentages. Additionally, the analysis aimed to differentiate between Work From Home (WFH) and Work From Office (WFO) percentages.

## Data Source : 
The attendance data was provided in the form of an Excel file. The data underwent Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations to prepare it for analysis.
## Steps Followed:
1. Understanding Problem:
Defined the scope of the analysis, focusing on attendance patterns, retention strategies, and sick leave percentages.
2. Data Gathering and Transformation:
Collected the attendance data from the provided Excel file.
Utilized ETL operations to clean and transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
3. Creating Metrics using DAX:
Implemented Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create key metrics, including attendance percentages, sick leave percentages, WFH percentages, and more.
4. Dashboarding with Power BI Desktop:
Utilized Power BI Desktop to visualize the data and create interactive dashboards.
Developed visualizations to provide insights into attendance trends, sick leave reasons, WFH vs. WFO percentages, and more.

## Project Outcome : 
The analysis presented in this dashboard will empower Atliq Technologies to make data-driven decisions regarding employee retention strategies. By understanding attendance patterns, reasons for sick leaves, and the balance between WFH and WFO percentages, the company can implement targeted actions to improve employee satisfaction and well-being.
